<p><b>By Dylan Schmidt</b></p>

<p>Unlike professional sports, the nature of college athletics has set programs up to succeed at home. With thousands of obnoxious college students screaming and heckling the opposing team’s players, home schools are given a boost, oftentimes leading to crazy upsets.</p>

<p>That wasn’t the case for Maryland women’s basketball last season throughout most of conference play, though.</p>

<p>The 2024-25 campaign was quite the unorthodox one for head coach Brenda Frese. Through Frese’s first 22 years at the helm of Maryland, she posted an incredible 323-50 home record and an 82-13 record in Big Ten games at College Park.</p>

<p>After a promising start to the year, the Terps regressed significantly once they hit the meat of their schedule.</p>

<p>Maryland began its season with a 6-0 home record during nonconference play, defeating Coppin State, then-No. 11 Duke, Towson, Saint Francis, Mount St. Mary’s and William & Mary by a combined margin of 36.67 points. </p>

<p>The Terps held on to beat then-No. 19 Michigan State and Rutgers to open Big Ten play. It looked like Maryland was on pace for another spectacular season and a shot at a national title.</p>

<p>However, the Terps ran into a massive obstacle: then-No. 4 USC. While Maryland would drop a tight contest, that was the start of a subpar stretch. The Terps secured just one home win in its next five contests, failing to notch a victory in College Park for over a month.</p>

<p>Maryland showed some late life in the season with home victories over Michigan and then-No. 12 Ohio State, salvaging its abysmal 5-4 home record during conference play.</p>

<p>Let’s compare that stretch of five home games to its season averages.</p>

<p>While the table emphasizes my point that the Terps played worse during the five-game home slate, strength of schedule plays a big factor in the differing records. Maryland’s toughest games of the season came during that stretch, facing two eventual No. 1 seeds in the NCAA Tournament in USC and UCLA. The Terps also played Illinois, who made it to the tournament.</p>

<p>And injuries took a toll on the team’s performance as well. During its 99-92 victory over then-No. 24 Minnesota, Maryland’s first significant injury unfolded. The Terps’ top defender and spark plug off the bench, guard Bri McDaniel, suffered a season-ending ACL tear in the first quarter.</p>

<p>McDaniel averaged 10.6 points per game in her 17 appearances and shot 50.7 percent from the field on the season. The junior also made timely plays in some of the Terps’ comeback victories. Her absence on both the offensive and defensive end was immediately felt and loomed large throughout Maryland’s season. </p>

<p>The following contest saw Shyanne Sellers go down with a knee injury, which forced her to miss two games. But Sellers was never able to fully recover, battling the same injury throughout the season and giving Terps’ fans several scares of a potential more severe reaggravation.</p>

<p>Saylor Poffenbarger also missed two games down the stretch as she dealt with a sprained ankle. </p>

<p>Maryland’s eight-person rotation was never all healthy in the remaining 16 games of the season, exposing its lack of roster depth. </p>

<p>Injuries and a five-game home gauntlet left the Terps with one of the worst home conference records in the Big Ten. </p>

<p>Maryland secured the No. 4-seed in the tournament, and it capitalized on the opportunity. The Terps defeated No. 13-seed Norfolk State and No. 5-seed Alabama in the opening two rounds before falling to top-seed South Carolina in a tight contest. </p>

<p>“A lot of teams would have folded, after losing Bri,” Frese said. “You’re going to have moments in life where you go through highs and you’re going to have some really low lows. For them, they can see how resilient they were through the course of the season.”</p>

<p>Maryland would also win its final four home games of the season, still leaving it with a 13-4 home record. However, a 10-1 record on the road erased the Terps disastrous conference home record. </p>
