<h1> ACC and Big Ten continue to thrive in women's lacrosse </h1>
</div>

<h3>By: Dylan Schmidt </h3>

<p> Women's lacrosse has historically been an East Coast dominant sport, and that is particularly evident in recent time. The Big Ten and ACC have firmly established themselves as the powerhouses of the sport, regularly producing the nation's top teams and players. Programs like North Carolina, Boston College, Maryland and Northwestern have racked up a steady amount of NCAA Tournament national titles in recent years. Their recruiting pipelines are unmatched, honing in on elite talents from traditional hotbeds like Maryladn, New York and Pennsylvania. As the graphic below displays, outside of James Madison's one title, ACC and Big Ten schools have each garnered four national titles combined.</p>

<p> While these conferences are producing national champions, they are regularly flooding the brackets with high quantity of teams representing. Last year, the Big Ten gathered five tournaments berths out of their seven programs in the conference. The ACC generated six tournnament teams last year as well. The high-end talent is also there with Northwestern, Boston College, Syracuse, Maryland, Virginia and Notre Dame bringing home six of the top seven national seeds in the tournament. And these programs are usually making deep runs in the tournament with the last nine Big Ten and ACC Tournament champions averaging around 2.66 wins, equating to a run to at least the Final Four. </p>

<p> Last year, three of the four schools represented in the NCAA Tournament semifinals came from either the Big Ten or ACC. These conferences look set to produce another high volume of tournament teams, as seven teams according to Intercollegiate Women's Lacrosse Coaches Association are ranked in the top-10 before the conference tournaments started. The winner of the ACC and Big Ten Tournament championships today will certainly be ones to look out for heading into the start of the NCAA Tournament. </p>
